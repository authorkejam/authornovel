## Chapter 2: Shadows of the Past

Elias found refuge in an abandoned chapel, its stone walls etched with forgotten prayers. The amulet's glow illuminated the dust motes dancing in the air, casting eerie shadows that seemed to whisper secrets of the dead.

He had been a child when he first heard the legends of the Death Relic. His grandmother, a wise woman with eyes like storm clouds, had warned him: "Some doors, once opened, cannot be closed."

But greed had blinded him. The relic promised power, eternal life, a chance to outrun the inevitable. Now, as the Reaper's presence pressed against the chapel doors, Elias questioned his choices.

Memories flooded back: his parents' funeral, the cold earth swallowing their coffins; his first theft, a desperate act to survive; the night he discovered the relic in a tomb guarded by spirits.

The doors creaked open, and a chill wind swept through. The Reaper stood there, not as a monster, but as a solemn judge. "You have disturbed the natural order," it intoned, its voice like the tolling of a funeral bell.

Elias backed away, the amulet burning against his skin. "I didn't know... I just wanted to live."

"Life without end is a curse, not a gift," the Reaper replied, extending a bony hand. "Return it, and I shall spare you... for now."

But Elias hesitated. The shadows of his past urged him to flee, to hold onto the power. The chase had only just begun, and the true horror of immortality was yet to unfold.
