## Chapter 1: The Chase Begins

In the shadowed alleys of the ancient city, where the moon hung like a silver scythe, Elias felt the cold breath of Death on his neck. He had always been a man of shadows, a thief who danced with danger, but tonight, the game had turned deadly.

The Grim Reaper himself was hunting him. Not the skeletal figure of folklore, but a presence, a whisper in the wind that promised oblivion. Elias had stolen something precious—a relic that bound the living to the dead—and now, the balance was shattered.

He ran through the cobblestone streets, his heart pounding like a war drum. Behind him, the echoes of footsteps that weren't quite footsteps, more like the rustle of dry bones against stone. He couldn't look back; he knew what he would see: a hooded figure with eyes like burning coals, scythe gleaming in the moonlight.

"Why me?" he gasped, ducking into a narrow alley. The relic, a small amulet pulsing with unnatural light, hung around his neck. It was said to grant immortality, but at what cost?

The Reaper's voice echoed in his mind: "Return what you have taken, mortal. The veil between worlds grows thin."

Elias clutched the amulet tighter. Immortality... freedom from death's cold embrace. But as the shadows lengthened and the Reaper drew closer, he wondered if some treasures were better left buried.
